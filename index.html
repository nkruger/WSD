						<p>The Hairy Crazy Ant, also known as the Crazy Rasberry ant, or the Caribbean Crazy ant, is invading the U.S. at an alarming rate.
					 	These little creatures, only about 2mm in length, move incredibly fast in a chaotic fashion, which is why every version of there name seems to contain the word "Crazy".
				 	 	The scientific name for them is <em>Nylanderia Pubens</em>.
					 	They often nest in electrical equipment, causing shorts in the wiring. <strong>They can also kill pets and infants.</strong></p>
 						<p>One thing that makes these pests so annoying is that they emit a pheromone when they die that attracts swarms of there friends.
 					 	If an ant is electrocuted in a transformer, others quickly overwhelm the area, getting themselves killed, but also killing the device.</p>
 					</section>
 					<p>Currently any attempts to slow there advancement have been mediocre at best. Colonies are so large that no amount of pesticides can wipe one out entirely, and they quickly rebuild their numbers.</p>

				<h3>What to do if you have these pests on your property</h3>
				<p>You should contact a local pest control company, rather than trying to eliminate these ants yourself.
				A trained professional will know what pesticides are allowed in your area, as well as know the latest techniques for dealing with ants.</p>
				<p>You can also help the scientific community in learning more about this species by sending samples to the <a href="http://www.lsuinsects.org/">Louisiana State Arthropod Museum</a>.
